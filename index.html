        <h2>Dating Methods</h2>
        <p><img src="images/trilos.jpg" class="wrap-image2">Some fossils, like trilobites and brachiopods, are called index fossils because they help scientists date rock layers. Trilobites (Eoredlichia, Redlichia) and Brachiopods (Lingulella) – These fossils are useful for figuring out the age of Cambrian rocks. (Zhang & Hou, 2004).</p>
        <p><img src='images/Relative.jpg' class='wrap-image2'>Because they lived for a short time but were widespread, index fossils help scientists match up rock layers from different places. (Gradstein et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Relative Dating compares Chengjiang fossils to other Cambrian fossils to estimate their age based on their position in rock layers. (Shu et al., 1999). Absolute Dating scientists use radiometric dating to analyze volcanic ash layers near Chengjiang, which show the site is about 520 million years old. (Zhu et al., 2005).</p>

        <h2>Plate Tectonics & Climate</h2>
        <p>520 million years ago, the Earth looked completely different. The supercontinent Gondwana covered most of the Southern Hemisphere, while Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia were separate land masses. </p>
        <img src='images/Allicanfind.jpg'>
        <p>Chengjiang was near the coast of what is now China, an area that was underwater at the time. (Scotese, 2009). This impact would have been massive on the global climate</p>
        <p>Most continents being cloer to the equator would mean the world was generally warmer and more humid. There were no polar ice caps, leading to higher sea levels and widespread shallow seas. (Shields, 2007).</p>
        <p>The Chengjiang site was located in a shallow marine environment near the equator, meaning it had warm tropical waters. This allowed for high biodiversity, as warm, nutrient-rich waters supported a range of soft-bodied organisms.</p>
        <p>Warmer waters led to less oxygen mixing, which might explain why some Chengjiang species lived in low-oxygen conditions. The shallow seas also helped with fossil preservation, as fine sediment quickly buried dead organisms. (Zhu et al., 2006).</p>

        <h2>Stratigraphy</h2>
        <p>Faunal Succession – Older fossils are found in deeper layers, while younger fossils are in the upper layers. (Gradstein et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Law of Superposition – In undisturbed rock layers, the oldest layers are at the bottom, and the newest ones are on top. (Chen et al., 1997).</p>
        <p>Law of Crosscutting – any geological feature (like a fault or intrusion) that cuts across or modifies another feature is younger than the feature it cuts. (www.nps.gov, n.d.)</p>
